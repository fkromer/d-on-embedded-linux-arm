# Interfacing with the OS

## /proc

For an example how to interact with `/proc` via a D script refer to the source code
[`readUptime.d`](https://github.com/fkromer/d-on-embedded-linux-arm/tree/master/code/proc/readUptime.d).

You can build the script `readUptime` with the build script `build` in the same directory.

## POSIX

For an example how to interact with the OS via `core.sys.posix` refer to the source code
[`whologgedin.d`](https://github.com/fkromer/d-on-embedded-linux-arm/tree/master/code/posix/whologgedin.d).

You can build the script `whologgedin` with the build script `build` in the same directory.
