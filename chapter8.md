# Introduction

In the following sections you will get some quick start guideance about how to get started with D development on embedded Linux
running on ARM processors.The BeagleBone Black is used as exemplary embedded Linux development board. A lot of documentation with
relation to common topics like the boards system architecture, hardware, etc. is available in the internet and in books.

## The intent

Helping others to learn how to use D in an embedded Linux environment.

## The vision

My personal vision is to use D in robotics. By providing a port of the existing
[main ROS client libraries](http://wiki.ros.org/Client%20Libraries) (C++, Python, Lisp) as experimental ROS client library
implemeneted in D (like e.g. Java, Go, etc.) ROS nodes implemented in D could be used as part of a ROS based system.
