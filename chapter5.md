## [D everywhere! (DConf Talk)](http://dconf.org/2016/talks/nacke.html)

> Abstract:  Using LLVM as backend enables LDC to target many CPU architectures,
> ranging from ARM and MIPS based embedded systems and smartphones over server
> systems based on POWER and Sparc up to the "big iron" z System. D everywhere
> seems possible!

## Developing in D

### [Shared libraries in D (DConf Talk)](http://dconf.org/2013/talks/nowak.html)

> Benefits: Getting an overview of what's possible and what should be
> possible with shared libraries.

### [D-Specific Design Patterns (DConf Talk)](http://dconf.org/2013/talks/simcha.html)

> Abstract:  The D programming language offers a variety of
> abstractions not found together in any other language. In particular,
> D's compile time metaprogramming facilities are a game changer,
> especially when combined with its low-level programming capabilities.

> Benefits: Attendees will be exposed to a variety of useful
> programming techniques that are obvious only in hindsight. These will
> certainly be useful in D and may even affect their programming style
> in other languages where these techniques are less obvious but still
> possible.

### [Code Analysis for D with AnalyzeD (DConf Talk)](http://dconf.org/2013/talks/rohe.html)

> Abstract: (...) Professional Programming in teams requires a common clean
> coding style. This could be enforced using code reviews, but the simpler and
> less offensive way to achieve this is by using a tool as style cop. (...)

### [Writing Testable D (DConf Talk)](http://dconf.org/2013/talks/gertzfield.html)

> Abstract: (...) The solution is to keep coders, not QA, responsible for
> maintaining the quality of their individual components, and to make it trivial
> and fast to run just the right tests that cover the code the coder changes. (...)
>
> Benefits: Learn how to write unit tests in D, and how to structure D code so
> it can be effectively unit tested.
